# opencv

OpenCV is a huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing. It can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even the handwriting of a human. The following are some of the functions I have implemented with it.

1. Face and eye detection 
1. Image manipulation
   1. Edge Detection
   1. Image smoothing 
   1. Image thresholding
   1. Image Transformation
1. Object Recognition
1. Webcam Streaming
